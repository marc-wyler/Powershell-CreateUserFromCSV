# Powershell-CreateUserFromCSV
Create User from an CSV File

First creates new Local Users from a CSV File and afterwards adds a group.
Users and Groups are separated because not every user should be in every group (to subdivide). 

Example CSV File is also in the repository (I first had some problems with the type, create one yourself by opening your notepad and saving it as .csv).
